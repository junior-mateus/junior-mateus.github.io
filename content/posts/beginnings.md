## How It All Started
Putting myself out there on the Internet is a huge step for me. Writing this already makes my heart beat faster. So, why am I doing this? Because “the best way to learn is to share with others” — I don’t know who said that, but I totally agree. I’ve been studying cybersecurity for 5 years. I started at 35. Until now, I haven’t really shared my journey. This brings me to why I’m starting this blog and YouTube channel.

When I started learning cybersecurity, I spent quite a lot on a bunch of courses. In the end, it was for most part a waste of money. Why? Was it because the courses weren’t good? No. I didn’t get much from them because of my mindset and approach. I mistook consuming information for learning. I thought that I was already too old to start and because of that, I felt I needed to go through the content as fast as I could. Lesson: take your time, don’t rush it. 

## Why I'm Doing This
What are my goals? I have two main goals. One is using this experience of writing/recording my progress to keep me consistent with my learning commitment. The other is connecting with people who also love cybersecurity, helping and learning from them. I believe I’ll also gain two valuable 'side effects': improving my English—especially when speaking—and learning some video editing.

## My 2025 Focus: Reverse Engineering, Exploits & Malware
2025: a year of challenges. I decided to make this the year I dive into reverse engineering, exploits, and malware. A little audacious, right? I’m currently enrolled in the Maldev Academy program and the Offsec’s 301 Windows User Mode Exploit Development. I’m not a developer, so how did I get ready for those courses? Since I knew I needed a strong foundation in programming, I started with 'C Programming for Everybody' on Coursera. Professor Charles Severance is incredible—I’ve taken other courses from him before and always enjoyed his teaching style. To reinforce my C skills, I’m now completing the C module in Boot.dev, which has also been a great resource. I won’t lie, the beginning of Maldev Academy wasn’t easy, but I’m loving it! Of all the courses I’ve taken, Maldev is by far my favorite.

## The Road Ahead
So, this blog and my channel will be my way of documenting this intense learning journey, sharing my struggles, wins, and lessons along the way. This year is going to be tough, and I have no idea how far I’ll get. But one thing is certain—I’m here to put in the work, I love this field, and I can't wait to see where this journey takes me. If you're also on a cybersecurity learning path—or thinking about starting—stick around. Let’s learn together. I’d love to hear your story! How did you get started in cybersecurity? Drop a comment or reach out—I’d love to connect.

And before I forget—I need to make something clear: I'm not an expert and I will not pretend to be. I'm here to learn, share, and connect with others who love cybersecurity as much as I do.

PS.: Why “The Cyber Nomad”? I like to pursue the topics that interest me the most, and those change often. Definition of nomad: a person who does not stay long in the same place, or a more modern approach: Intellectual/Curious Nomad: A person who constantly explores different ideas, fields, or skills rather than sticking to just one.
